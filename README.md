**Project Title:** Intrusion Detection System with Machine Learning

**Description:**

Every 39 seconds, a cyber attack threatens our digital world. This project builds an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to stand as a vigilant first line of defense. We'll leverage machine learning classifiers to accurately detect and classify various types of cyber attacks, safeguarding networks from malicious intrusions.

**Key Features:**

*   **Data:** Utilizes the SIMARGL2021 dataset, a comprehensive collection of benign and malicious network traffic.
*   **Exploratory Analysis:**  Thoroughly explores the dataset to understand its features, attack types, and potential redundancies.
*   **Visualization:** Visualizes data to grasp the distribution and proportion of different labels (attack types) in the dataset.
*   **Model Training:** Trains and tests a variety of machine learning classifiers, including:
    *   Random Forest
    *   Decision Tree
    *   Gaussian Naive Bayes
*   **Accuracy Assessment:**  Rigorously evaluates the accuracy of each trained classifier to identify the most effective model for intrusion detection.

**Goal:**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning-based IDS capable of detecting and classifying diverse cyber attacks with high accuracy.  By training on real-world network traffic data, the IDS will learn to identify patterns associated with malicious activity, enabling it to proactively protect against potential threats.
